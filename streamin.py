#We are building a music streaming service. We have provided two lists, representing songs in a userâ€™s library and the amount of times each song has been played
songs = ["Like a Rolling Stone", "Satisfaction", "Imagine", "What's Going On", "Respect", "Good Vibrations"]
playcounts = [78, 29, 44, 21, 89, 5]

plays = {song:playcount for [song, playcount] in zip(songs, playcounts)}
print(plays)

plays["Respect"] = 94
plays["Purple Haze"] = 1

library = {"The Best Songs": plays, "Sunday Feelings": {}}

print(library)
